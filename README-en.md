# Hakan YÃ¼cel Personal Website

I'm interested in programming and self-development. Self-contained software developer.I like to research software problems and solve them with modern technologies.

The important thing is that I create and optimize business portfolios that matter. To accomplish this, I focus on delivering key outcomes, working with great teams, and adapting quickly to new learnings

I'm passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best.
